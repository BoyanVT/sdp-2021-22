[https://www.baeldung.com/cs/array-generate-all-permutations](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/array-generate-all-permutations) - up to 4. Heap's algorithm, unless you are curious, an admirable quality.

#### Exercise proposal
Generate all combinations of k elements of the elements of a given array with size - n
>Input: \
n k \
a1 a2 a3 .. an \
Output: \
a11 a12 a13 .. a1n \
.. \
al1 al2 al3 .. aln, \
where l = n!/k!(n-k)! \
(binomial coefficient, the number of all possible combinations of n elements with size k)

Hint: has to do with the things we discussed for the permutation.
